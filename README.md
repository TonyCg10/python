Anime Searcher (path: anime_searcher/Anime Searcher/main.exe)
The Anime Searcher application is a comprehensive project built with PyQt. It enables users to search, filter, and display anime from an offline database based on various criteria such as title, year, season, tags, and more. Key features include:

Title Search: Search by exact title or by any substring in the title.
Criteria Search: Filter by type, year, season, status, tags, etc.
Random Anime Generator: Discover a random anime with a single click.
Dynamic UI Elements: Includes custom search widgets and an anime details viewer with image and text descriptions.
To try the app, see the setup instructions below.

Python Library Exercises
NumPy
Explorations of NumPy covering topics like array creation, indexing, slicing, vectorized operations, and broadcasting. These exercises help in understanding the power of numerical computing with efficient data structures.

Pandas
Practical code examples that illustrate data handling with Pandas, such as reading and cleaning data, merging DataFrames, grouping data, and advanced indexing techniques for data manipulation.

PyQt
Exercises that walk through the fundamentals of PyQt, including UI setup, layout management, widget customization, and event handling.

Algorithms and Complexities
This section contains implementations and analyses of fundamental algorithms, with an emphasis on understanding their time and space complexities. Topics covered include:

Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort, along with complexity comparisons.
Search Algorithms: Linear search, binary search, and an introduction to search complexities.
Data Structures: Explorations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, with notes on their time and space efficiency.
Algorithm Optimization: Examples demonstrating the importance of algorithmic efficiency and the impact of Big O notation on performance.
